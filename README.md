The MTech/PhD Stipend Management Portal is a web-based application 
that simplifies the process of managing stipends for MTech and PhD students and 
faculty members at universities and research institutions.
Users, including both students and faculty members, can log in to the app using 
login credentials provided by their college. Students can fill out the application form 
on the app, which has a deadline for submissions. Once the form is submitted, it is 
sent to the student's supervisor for review of attendance and form. If the supervisor 
finds any issues, the form can be disapproved and sent back to the student for 
revisions. If it is approved, it is sent to the Head of Department for further review, 
who can approve or disapprove the form with the appropriate reason. Approved 
forms are then sent to a designated teacher/coordinator who handles the 
coordination of the stipend with AICTE.
The app also features a section for professors/supervisors/HOD to submit progress 
reports of students, a section where students can check the status of their application 
and download their receipt, and a section for statistics reports that displays past 
performance of students. Additionally, there is a grievance section where students 
can raise concerns
